title: Using S3 as an exfiltration mechanism

facts:
- local_data_access: Adversary has local access to data, e.g. a CSV
  from:
  - reality:
- aws_account_access: Has access to an organisation's AWS account, e.g. member of an app or platform team 
  from:
  - local_data_access:
- server_access_logs: Attacker has server access logs enabled in their CF distribution or S3 Bucket
  from:
  - allowed_webbrowsing: 
  - leaky_vpc_endpoint:

attacks:
- no_least_privilege_iam: IAM policy is not least privilege
  from:
  - aws_account_access
- curl_s3: curl GET arbitrary s3 bucket
  from:
  - local_data_access:

- allowed_webbrowsing: "*.s3.amazonaws.com allowlisted"
  from:
  - proxy_firewall:
- no_proxy: There are no egress controls for internet traffic 
  from:
  - outside_vpc:
  - curl_s3

- leaky_vpc_endpoint: The policy on the VPC endpoint is not least privilege/access, e.g. resource:*, action:* 
  from:
  - inside_vpc:


mitigations:
- least_privilege_iam: IAM policy allows only specific account, resources, networks
  from:
  - no_least_privilege_iam

- inside_vpc: Your endpoint is inside a VPC and can only use a VPC endpoint to reach to S3
  from:
  - least_privilege_iam
  - no_least_privilege_iam

- outside_vpc: Your endpoint is outside a VPC 
  from:
  - least_privilege_iam
  - no_least_privilege_iam

- proxy_firewall: Proxy/Firewall/CASB prevents access 
  from:
  - no_proxy

- vpc_endpoint: VPC endpoint enforces principal, resource, account, or network conditions
  from:
  - inside_vpc


goals:
- exfiltration: Exfiltrate Data
  from:
  - server_access_logs:
  - no_proxy:
